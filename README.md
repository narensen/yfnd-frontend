A powerful tool to generate robust FastAPI backend code (and optional frontend) with ease. Built with Python, FastAPI, and AI-driven code generation, this project streamlines development by creating efficient, debugged, and production-ready code based on natural language prompts.

## Features
- **Backend Generation**: Creates optimized FastAPI backend code tailored to your prompt.
- **Full-Stack Option**: Optionally generates a single-file HTML/CSS frontend to complement the backend.
- **AI-Powered**: Leverages advanced language models for code generation, planning, and debugging.
- **Fast & Flexible**: Built with FastAPI for high performance and easy customization.
- **Downloadable Output**: Saves generated code to `downloads/` for immediate use.

## How It Works
1. Send a prompt to the `/generate` endpoint describing your desired backend functionality.
2. The system generates a plan, writes the code, debugs it, and returns the result.
3. Optionally request full-stack generation to get a matching frontend.
4. Access the polished code via the API response or download it from the `downloads/` directory.
